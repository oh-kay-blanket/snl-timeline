    "summary": "The inaugural season (1975-76) was a radical experiment that revolutionized late-night television. Created by Lorne Michaels, the show aimed to capture the counterculture zeitgeist with edgy, irreverent comedy that appealed to young audiences. The original Not Ready for Prime Time Players became cultural icons, and the show's live format created an unpredictable energy. Critics were initially mixed, with some viewing it as self-indulgent, but the show quickly gained a devoted following and established itself as a cultural phenomenon that reflected the post-Watergate era's skepticism toward authority.",
