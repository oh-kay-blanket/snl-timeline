1	1975-1976	Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Garrett Morris, George Coe, Gilda Radner, Jane Curtin, John Belushi, Laraine Newman, Michael O'Donoghue	Chevy Chase	The Start of it All	The inaugural season (1975-76) was a radical experiment that revolutionized late-night television. Created by Lorne Michaels, the show aimed to capture the counterculture zeitgeist with edgy, irreverent comedy that appealed to young audiences. The original Not Ready for Prime Time Players became cultural icons, and the show's live format created an unpredictable energy. Critics were initially mixed, with some viewing it as self-indulgent, but the show quickly gained a devoted following and established itself as a cultural phenomenon that reflected the post-Watergate era's skepticism toward authority.

The cast gelled as an ensemble, and the show's influence on American comedy became undeniable. Behind the scenes, drug use was becoming prevalent, and tensions were developing between cast members vying for screen time. The show won its first Emmy for Outstanding Comedy-Variety Series, validating Michaels' vision. Culturally, SNL became appointment television for young adults and college students, with cast members achieving mainstream celebrity status.

The cast was firing on all cylinders, and the show's cultural influence reached its zenith. However, behind the scenes, drug abuse was rampant, and the grueling schedule was taking its toll on the cast and writers. John Belushi's film career was beginning, signaling the eventual breakup of the original cast. Critics hailed it as must-see TV, and the show's impact on popular culture was immense, with catchphrases and characters becoming part of the national conversation.

Exhaustion, burnout, and outside opportunities led to declining ensemble chemistry. Lorne Michaels knew this would be his last season, and several cast members were preparing to leave. The show was still critically acclaimed and culturally relevant, but there was a sense of an era ending. Behind the scenes, there were conflicts over money and creative control, and the pressure of maintaining the show's success was overwhelming.

With Lorne Michaels and most of the original cast gone, NBC handed the show to Jean Doumanian, an inexperienced producer. The new cast was largely unknown and struggled to find their footing. Critics savaged the season as unwatchable, and ratings plummeted. Behind the scenes, there was chaos—poor writing, lack of direction, and a toxic work environment. The cultural impact was negative; the show became a punchline, with many calling for its cancellation. This season is widely considered the worst in SNL history.

Ebersol's goal was to save the show from cancellation, which meant playing it safer. Critics were cautiously optimistic as the season progressed, particularly praising Murphy's breakout performances. Behind the scenes, Ebersol fought to keep the show on the air while rebuilding its reputation. The cultural impact was modest but positive—the show was recovering but not yet back to its former glory.	Malcolm McDowell, Ellen Burstyn, Karen Black, Charlene Tilton	The Chieftains, Dr. Hook, James Brown, Linda Ronstadt	Eddie Murphy early appearances, Weekend Update transitions, rebuilding-focused season
7	1981-1982	Christine Ebersole, Eddie Murphy, Joe Piscopo, Mary Gross, Robin Duke, Tim Kazurinsky, Tony Rosato, Brian Doyle-Murray	Brian Doyle-Murray, Christine Ebersole, Mary Gross	The Eddie Murphy Show	Season seven (1981-82) marked a resurgence thanks almost entirely to Eddie Murphy's star power. Murphy became the first cast member since the original era to achieve true cultural phenomenon status. Behind the scenes, the show was essentially "The Eddie Murphy Show," which created resentment among other cast members. Critics praised Murphy while noting the show's overall inconsistency. The cultural impact was significant—Murphy was keeping SNL relevant and bringing in younger, more diverse audiences. However, the show still hadn't recaptured its original ensemble magic.

Billy Crystal joined as a featured player, adding star power. Behind the scenes, there was tension about the show's direction post-Murphy and pressure to develop new stars. Critics acknowledged the show's dependence on Murphy and worried about its sustainability. The cultural impact remained strong due to Murphy's presence, but there was anxiety about whether SNL could survive another major transition.

9	1983-1984	Brad Hall, Eddie Murphy, Gary Kroeger, Jim Belushi, Joe Piscopo, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Mary Gross, Robin Duke, Tim Kazurinsky	Brad Hall, Joe Piscopo	The Dream Team That Didn't Last	Season nine (1983-84) saw major cast turnover as Eddie Murphy left for his film career. Billy Crystal became a full cast member, and the show brought in several future stars including Martin Short, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer. Behind the scenes, Dick Ebersol was trying to build a new ensemble. Critics were mixed—the talent was clearly there, but the chemistry was still developing. The cultural impact waned without Murphy, though the show maintained respectable ratings and remained culturally relevant, if not culturally dominant.

Behind the scenes, Ebersol was burned out and planning his exit. The show was well-crafted and professional but lacked the raw edge of earlier eras. Critics generally praised the cast's talent while noting the show felt safer and more conventional. The cultural impact was solid but not groundbreaking—SNL was a respected institution but no longer the edgy upstart.

The ambitious reboot was a creative and critical disaster. Behind the scenes, there was chaos as Michaels tried to recapture the original magic with a young, inexperienced cast. Critics were harsh, and ratings were poor. The cultural impact was minimal—the show was again in danger of cancellation. This season taught Michaels that you couldn't simply recreate 1975.	Madonna, Ron Reagan Jr., Oprah Winfrey, Robin Williams	Simple Minds, Metallica, Paul Simon, Al Green	Master Thespian (Jon Lovitz), Pathological Liar debut, Church Lady debut, Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer

This rebuilding year was focused on finding the right chemistry. Behind the scenes, Michaels was more hands-on and deliberate in his approach. Critics were cautiously optimistic, noting improvements. The cultural impact was modest—the show was slowly regaining credibility but still searching for its identity. This season laid the groundwork for the resurgence that was coming.

The cast was gelling, particularly Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, and Jan Hooks. Dennis Miller's Weekend Update was gaining acclaim. Behind the scenes, confidence was growing, and the show was finding its voice again. Critics praised the ensemble's chemistry and the return of political satire. The cultural impact was growing—characters like Hans and Franz and the Church Lady were entering the cultural lexicon. SNL was becoming relevant again.

The show was hitting its stride with strong ensemble work and memorable characters. Behind the scenes, there was renewed creative energy and confidence. Critics lauded the show's return to form, and ratings improved significantly. The cultural impact was substantial—SNL was once again must-see TV, with characters and catchphrases dominating pop culture. The show was proving it could reinvent itself and remain relevant.

The cast was arguably the best ensemble since the 1970s, with Carvey, Hartman, Myers, Hooks, Lovitz, and others all at their peaks. Behind the scenes, morale was high, and the creative process was clicking. Critics hailed it as a golden age, and ratings were excellent. The cultural impact was enormous—Wayne's World was a phenomenon, political impressions were influential, and SNL was again a cultural institution. This season proved the show's resilience and enduring appeal.

The cast remained strong despite turnover. Behind the scenes, there was some tension over the show's treatment of women and minority cast members. Critics continued to praise the show, though some noted these behind-the-scenes controversies. The cultural impact remained high, with the show dominating late-night comedy. The Gulf War provided timely political material, and SNL's satirical edge was sharp.

Behind the scenes, a new generation was taking over from the late-80s stars. Critics noted the transition but remained positive about the show's direction. The cultural impact was strong, with Farley's physical comedy and Sandler's musical bits becoming cultural touchstones.

David Spade and Rob Schneider became more prominent, and the cast skewed younger. Behind the scenes, there was pressure to develop new stars quickly. Critics were mixed, noting the loss of veteran talent but praising the energy of newer cast members. The cultural impact remained solid, particularly with the younger demographic that connected with Farley, Sandler, and Spade's humor. Political satire took a backseat to character-based comedy.

The show was criticized for inconsistency as it searched for a new identity. Behind the scenes, there was uncertainty about the show's direction and concerns about sketch quality. Critics were increasingly harsh, with some declaring SNL in decline. The cultural impact waned somewhat—while popular characters remained, the show wasn't dominating cultural conversation as it had.

Following Phil Hartman, Julia Sweeney, and Rob Schneider's departures, the show brought in Chris Elliott and Janeane Garofalo, who quit mid-season citing a toxic, sexist environment and "juvenile and homophobic" material. Behind the scenes, there was chaos—Lorne Michaels later said this was the closest he ever came to being fired. Critics savaged the show, culminating in a devastating New York magazine cover story titled "How 'Saturday Night Live' Became a Grim Joke." The cultural impact was disastrous—NBC executives threatened cancellation, and the show's reputation hit rock bottom. This crisis forced the most dramatic overhaul since season six.

Nine cast members were fired or left, including Chris Farley and Adam Sandler—controversial firings driven by NBC executives (particularly Don Ohlmeyer) pressuring Michaels to overhaul the show or face cancellation. Only five cast members returned: Norm Macdonald, Mark McKinney, Tim Meadows, Molly Shannon, and David Spade. New hires included Will Ferrell, Cheri Oteri, and Darrell Hammond. Behind the scenes, Michaels drastically reduced the budget and streamlined operations. Critics were cautiously optimistic about the new direction. The cultural impact was modest—the show was stabilizing but needed time to develop new stars. This was a transitional season focused on survival and rebuilding credibility.

Ana Gasteyer and Tracy Morgan joined the cast, while David Spade left after serving as a bridge between eras. Behind the scenes, there was renewed focus on developing the cast that had been brought in the previous year. Critics acknowledged gradual improvement and stronger ensemble work. The cultural impact was growing—the show leaned heavily on recurring characters like the Spartan Cheerleaders and Celebrity Jeopardy, which became popular. Notably, seven former cast members returned to host this season (Dana Carvey, Chris Rock, Robert Downey Jr., Phil Hartman, Martin Short, Chevy Chase, and Mike Myers), signaling the show's attempt to reconnect with past glory while building its future.

Chris Farley hosted in October 1997 and died two months later; Phil Hartman was murdered by his wife shortly after the season finale. Behind the scenes, the most significant event was NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer forcing Norm Macdonald off Weekend Update mid-season (December 1997), reportedly due to Macdonald's relentless O.J. Simpson jokes—Ohlmeyer was Simpson's friend. Writer Jim Downey was also fired. Colin Quinn replaced Macdonald awkwardly mid-season. Critics noted the behind-the-scenes turmoil and mourned the deaths of two beloved alumni. The cultural impact was mixed—the show was improving creatively but the Macdonald firing became one of SNL's most infamous moments, representing NBC's most heavy-handed interference since the mid-90s crisis.

Critics praised the improvement and more diverse sketch work. The cultural impact was positive—the show was regaining credibility and consistency.

Bush. Will Ferrell's Bush and Darrell Hammond's Gore became iconic, with Ferrell later suggesting his "humanized" portrayal may have helped Bush win. Behind the scenes, Tina Fey became head writer (the first woman in that role) and joined Jimmy Fallon as Weekend Update co-anchor, creating a more playful dynamic. Tim Meadows, Cheri Oteri, and Colin Quinn all left after this season. Critics hailed the political satire as some of SNL's best work. The cultural impact was substantial—phrases like "strategery" and "lockbox" entered the cultural lexicon, and SNL was again central to political discourse during a presidential election.

Behind the scenes, the cast and crew grappled with how to do comedy in a changed America. Critics praised the show's handling of the tragedy and its return to satire. The cultural impact was immense—SNL's response to 9/11 was seen as a moment of national healing, demonstrating comedy's power in dark times. Will Ferrell's final season was also bittersweet.

The show brought in newer cast members to fill the gap, but the transition was rocky. Behind the scenes, there was pressure to develop new stars quickly. Critics were harsh, noting a drop in quality and consistency. The cultural impact diminished without Ferrell's star power. The show struggled to find its footing, though Tina Fey and Jimmy Fallon's Weekend Update remained a bright spot. This season highlighted SNL's dependence on breakout stars.

The show was criticized for relying too heavily on dated premises and celebrity cameos. Behind the scenes, there were concerns about the show's relevance to younger audiences. Critics were increasingly negative, with some suggesting SNL had lost its edge. The cultural impact was modest—while the show remained popular, it wasn't driving cultural conversation.
